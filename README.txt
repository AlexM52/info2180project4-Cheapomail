The repository contains Everything I've managed to complete on Project 4 (Cheapomail)

I've successfully implemented AJAX functionality and all content can be accessed without refreshing the browser or navigating to a new page.

Code to modify the appearance of messages which have been read is in place, but not working.

Did not get to add in message reply functionality.

Login/session management is working.

Home page displaying list of 10 (if 10+ messages in system) messages at a time is working.

Composition and sending of message is working.

Receive and read message is working.

Did not get to implement new message notification and automatic recheck for new messages, though some code fragments in place.place

Sorry for any garbage comments still left in code.code
